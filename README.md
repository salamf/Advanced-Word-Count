# Advanced Word Count
This is a program that takes input from a file (given through the args) and then prints out information about the words of the file to standard output. It prints out the amount of words that are of each length in the file. It prints them in decedning SORTED order and the median of the word lengths if (--sorted) is given in the args. If (--print-words) is also given, it prints out the same info in sorted order along with each of the words that are of that length sorted alphabetically, no duplicate words are printed.
